//! libmount
//!
//! This library has two major goals:
//!
//! 1. Add type-safe interface for mount() system call
//! 2. Add very good explanation of what's wrong when the call fails
//!
//! So we have two error types:
//!
//! 1. `OSError` holds mount info and errno
//! 2. `Error` is returned by `OSError::explain()`
//!
//! The first one is returned by `bare_mount()` the second by `mount()`, and
//! using latter is preffered for most situations. Unless performance is
//! too critical (i.e. you are doing thousands of *failing* mounts per second).
//! On the success path there is no overhead.
//!

/// library makes some probes for different things in filesystem, and if
/// anything changes it may give incorrect results.

/// You should always `explain()` the errors, unless you are trying lots of

/// performance. Usually library does `stat()` and similar things which are
/// much faster than mount anyway. Also explaining is zero-cost in the success
